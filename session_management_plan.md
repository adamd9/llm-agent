# Session Management Refactor Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation and improvements to the session management system for the AI Agent chat interface. The new architecture follows a persistent, single-session model where all clients share one conversation state and memory.

## Current Status
- ✅ Session management architecture implemented with SessionManager class
- ✅ Persistent chat history with ChatLogWriter
- ✅ WebSocket handling refactored for shared session
- ✅ Cancellation/interrupt mechanism implemented
- ✅ Manual session reset capability added
- ✅ Bug fixes for chat history and system status persistence
- ✅ UI improvements for reset button

## Notes
- The new architecture is a persistent, single-session model: all clients share one conversation state and memory.
- SessionManager class created; manages session state, connected clients, busy flag, idle timeout, and history.
- ChatLogWriter implemented for persistent chat log with file rotation.
- ChatLogWriter now supports reading/loading history from file (readHistory method).
- WebSocket handling refactored: all clients join the shared session, receive full history on connect, and get real-time updates.
- Frontend updated to use server session history, handle new event types, and reset on session reset.
- Frontend updated to support cancellation/interrupt mechanism (interrupt button sends cancel request to server).
- Idle timeout trims in-memory history, consolidates memory, and notifies clients.
- Cancellation/interrupt mechanism implemented in SessionManager (user can abort running request).
- Manual reset capability added to SessionManager (resetSession method); server-side wiring complete.
- Frontend now receives resetResult/reset events; button styling and click handler added, and syntax/lint errors in chat.js resolved.
- Frontend handler logic for reset button implemented (send request & handle resetResult).
- Outstanding areas: multi-channel input (email, CLI), and advanced presence/notification logic.
- Support for loading chat history from file after server restart implemented.
- WebSocket client handling is complete.
- Local echo for user messages added and duplicate broadcast echoes suppressed.
- Server-side tracking of system status messages implemented.
- Reset button moved to system-controls div and relabelled to "Reset Session".

  - [x] Ensure user messages appear instantly and persist
  - [x] Determine handling of transient/system status messages and decide persistence strategy
  - [x] Add local echo of user message on send
  - [x] Prevent duplicate display when server broadcast arrives
