1. Implement a text to speech feature in the front-end.
2. Externalise the prompts into plain text files for easier editing (need to somehow also make it clear in the file what vars it expects to need in the template)
3. Implement a 'reflection' action that allows the agent to reflect on its own actions and make a decision on what to do next. It might be a core capabiltiy rather than a tool
4. Take a better look at the planner and see if it can be improved
